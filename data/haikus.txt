the cheery yellow taxi that takes you away my dark mood
such a joy while washing my feet just a couple of words
drilling deeper	my dentist talks me into	amnesty international

in the old folks home	practicing christmas carols	children again
out of the mud of another eon something firm
a flow of snow	returning the wave	foaming surf
a cricket cries just once suddenly my life
torchlight	inviting rocks by the pond	to dance on water
bee lines	exciting the air	between flowers
a train in madrid so many cell phones unanswered
this heat	the dogs tail	the only breeze
not really tired	a summer day	lays down to rest

a rusty wood stove	warmth spreads into the room	starshaped
eaves dripping	the candle flame	flickers
mad at myself	the ball keeps hitting	its own shadow

a single strand	of spider silk	stops her
after the heavy rains so many skies tonight reflecting the moon
what he remembers of his first time with a girl la petite mord
organ music	the school principals words	go to my office
summer chill a man guts sculpin at the fish mart
asked how old he was a boy in a new kimono stretched out all five fingers
huge limbs of the live oak	their reaching out	over the young grass
home again	a pulse of tides	in our blood
desert chill the ocotillos long reach to the stars

children play in the broken boat of the rice field
winter weaves	a pile of pillows	on a hard chair
hard flash of light	stabbed by a knife	falling into water
sun boils over the mesa a cholla bud opens red
first day of school in the almost empty bag an apple rolls about
briefly her eyes unglue from the iphone fireflies
incoming tide	moving the chairs	to the porch
methodical husband	on his list of chores she finds	her name
between mountains	desert night wind	on a full breast

coming up through	a gap in the city bridge	a checkerspot butterfly
up and down	driftwood lairs of lovers	come and go
one cricket sound and silence lighting the autumn garden
mountain woman	cadence of rolling hills	in her breast
sun shine	in a drop of melting snow	the river black
the first drops of rain striking the limestone shelter colour again

in the marrow	of my own bones	a morning star
behind grillwork	down darkness to sun	in a hidden courtyard

the sun and the mountain do this
a marmots whistle pierces the mountain first star
waves at the shore telling excitedly from distant ships

under the tree	a planted feather
water lilies	centers of the pond	close at night
above the horizon people scattered shell gathering
on the brim of a brimming stone bowl a stone
a wobbly line	of black writing	a spider walks by

no paper i write a haiku on a shell
subway crowd on this navy blue coat a grey hair
first light i rise the way mountains are made
balance act	with a gust of wind	a crash of bowls
bowed heads heavy after daffodils spelling the spring
her empty seat in the quiet living room i miss her silence
sometimes i feel the need to cry but the sea does it for me
may rains where i go to leak the roof does too
sleeping in the sun	only surfer dreams	ride the bright waves
her face	a fold in fabric	smiles
canyon springs	where water rest in light	travelers pause
old guard escorting me	coughing like bullfrog	cigarette smoke for breath
early april rain	that woman fills every jar	seals them forever
rape the breaking off of everything

rodeo cowboy hopefully clutching a handful of sky
dense fog we built up a world of words
autumn old age is in the birds the clouds
tasting she sticks her tongue out at the winter
train whistle a blackbird hops along its notes
spindrift	a cloud hangs	where a wave broke
champion	on the flying trapeze	a butterfly
broken clouds as soon as i leave the house i think of home
machine gun fire she stirs more honey in her tea
young lawyer	his briefs	in the snow
fireflies my neighbor has more
grandfathers funeral	cousin kate air kissing	spies a mirror checks her makeup
cafe for sale	outdoor tables rusting	into autumn
the lake thawing	an image of a woman	awaking
roof newly shingled	nestled under pine cones	lady bugs
sunset	stumbling over rocks	shadows
still beautiful	the barren woman admires	flowering cherry
slowly the sunset spreads endless prairie
arches	splashing rain	on a tin roof
deep in winter	the babbling brook	white as stone
evening winds	the tiny bay filled	up to the cliff
gone for years the poplar he planted is full of birds
nights	where you touched me	a cricket chirps
melted snow seeing off winter down the river
birth certificate the name of the father he never knew
opening night	missing the entrance	of the night blooming cereus
steepening the hillside	deer nibble wild flowers	above the autumn sea
putting the dulcimer away	the last note lingers	drops to the floor
to touch stars	her outstretched hand	fills with snowflakes
with the oceans roar	i climb the hills home	not alone
like nothing ever happened dandelion
mineral baths	at night the many colors	in dreams
winter dawn comes	the sound of blowing snow	sleeping birds

how soft they appear the needles of the pine tree after the first snow
cinnamon red	the fragrance of sequoia	in the color
spring winds	the old lady tries again	to tidy her hair
his wristwatch still ticking in the casket
a shrill cry	overheated the cicada peels	out of its skin
in hot springs	the moon warms itself	between us
precipice	the wind blows stronger	my fear of falling
last sip	bitter taste of earth	in the water
light on silver birch like a sparrow lost in cuckoo flowers i cry
the persistence of his image peonies

the childless woman	fishes with her man	bracelets of salt
silence	around lovers	a silver cord
hearth stones	around dark embers	warmth

without a soul	faces grin in the dark	on halloween
