# Model list

Things to try:

Model size: 

* 512 node with dropout
* 512 node without dropout
* 256 node with dropout
* 256 node without dropout
* 128 node with dropout
* 128 node without dropout

Model options:

* LSTM layer options
* Cosine proximity
* Adagrad

After training full models, look for elbows and train for less epochs
